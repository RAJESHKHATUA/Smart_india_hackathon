# Smart_india_hackathon
I and my team(Team Mediwatch) participated in smart india   college level hackathon. We used wifi module (esp32/esp8266) and other sensors to make a health monitoring and alert system.
         To address the critical issue of timely response during health emergencies, our project is dedicated to developing a comprehensive health monitoring system. Particularly in situations where an individual is alone and experiences a heart attack or any other life-threatening situations, the inability to contact an ambulance independently further underscores the critical need for swift emergency response. Often, such patients find themselves incapacitated and unable to call for help. In such dire circumstances, every passing moment amplifies the risk of irreversible damage or even fatality.
         The primary objective is to automate the process of alerting the nearest hospital. In such cases the hospital can take necessary actions such as dispatching an ambulance whenever a patient experiences a heart attack or any equivalent severe health issue.
